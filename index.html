<P> <B>Nathan Bresser, s3819728, bressernathan@gmail.com</B>
  
  <P> I’m a twenty four year old Canberra native currently living in Sydney and working for a big four consulting firm. My grandparents immigrated from The Netherlands to Australia in the sixties. I graduated high school in 2012 and have about two thirds of the credits to complete a degree in Accounting at the University of Wollongong which I have put on hold to pursue my passion of IT. 
  
  <P> One interesting fact about me is that in 2013 I represented Australia at a 3 on 3 basketball tournament in shanghai. We placed second, losing by a point to China in the final.
  <P> I’ve been interested in all aspects of IT since I was a young child. At the moment my primary interest is in programming and software development. My interest began when my farther bought our families first computer in 1999. A few years later he went on so pursue a degree in computer science, so computers where a part of mine and my siblings lives from then on. 
  <P> After mulling over the decision of whether or not to go ahead with changing career paths from finance to IT I have looking in numerous different courses. Eventually I settled on RMIT through OUA as it allowed me to enrol in courses prior to being accepted into a degree. 
  <P> My expectation is to learn about a wide range of subjects relating to IT and to leave the course in a position to pursue a career in an IT role.

         <P>
           
    <P>This role involves working within the BCG Digital team on designing, developing, implementing and monitoring software solutions for clients. Specifically in the field of IT transformations.
    <P>To be successful in applying for this role I would need to complete a degree in IT or Computer science so that I would have the technical understanding to be a useful member of the team. The role also requires several years’ experience in DevOps or IT consulting, or in planning and implementing IT transformations.
    <P>Currently I do not have a undergraduate degree in any applicable IT field. I do have experience in IT transformation, having worked on projects to implement new management information systems and General Ledger systems with an ASX 500 business. I have also experience at a big 4 consulting firm on designing and developing a contractor tracking portal. I also have 4 year experience in accounting and finance and have worked for 12 months as a systems accountant.
    <P>To apply for this role I would need to first complete my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT and at the same time transition to a more IT focused role at my current employer.

      
<P> <B>Personal Profile</B>
  
    <P>MBTI Results
      
    <P>My personally based on the MBIT test I completed was ENFP. My core values indicated by the test were, Curiosity, Self-expression, Variety and Adaptability and my Key motivators were expressing creativity, new ideas, Understanding people and providing acceptance and support. (Truity, 2019)
   <P>The text identified my type code as “the champion”. Champions focus on new possibilities and helping others explore them. They are people focused and general warm, passionate and energetic.
      <P>Learning Style Test Results
    <P>The Learning Style test that I complete indicated that I am a tactile learner (Educationplanner.org, 2019).  My overall breakdown was as follows. 50% tactile, 30% visual and 20% Auditory. Tactile learners learn by physically going through the motions of doing something. They fidget and like to pull things apart and put them back to together again to see how they work.
    <P>Personal Choice of Test  
    <P>I also completed an only psychometric text for abstract reasoning. This required me to find the missing item in sequences and matrixes of shapes and symbols. This was the first time I have attempted a test like this and I was only able to get to 4 of the 15 questions in the seven minutes and thirty seconds of time provided. I was able to answer 3 of the questions correctly. (JobTestPrep, 2019)
   
  <P>The results of these tests mean very little to me. Having taken a few of these kinds of personality and learning type tests I’ve found that the results can vary widely from test to test and how I am feeling on a particular day. I’ve also found that the insights they provide to be of little use, specifically the MBIT. To me it seems to be just regurgitating information you provide in a different format, not telling you anything new about yourself.
  <P>It’s possible that having your learning and personality type given to you might allow you to feel more comfortable being who you are and accepting that you have your own way of acting and reacting to your team members and your own way of taking up information. Being able to relax and be who you are can only help when working in a team in my opinion.
  <P>  Without people going out of their way to publicize the results of these tests it would be difficult to use this information when forming teams, if however you were putting a team together and you had all of this information at hand, I can image that you might at the very least be able to use the results to communicate with you team members about who you are and how best you communicate in learn.

    
   <P> <B>IT Project Idea</B>
  
  <P>Overview
  <P>The IT project that I have selected to is to build a workflow management tool. The tool will allow users to define, create and manage their workflow, project or day to day work and allow their team members to add and update information relating to that workflow. The solution would be developed in either Java or Python with will connect to a sql database to store the information. Users will be able to meticulously design and develop their project or workflow structure as well as track and provide feedback to their team as they work through items in the workflow. 
  <P>Motivation
    <P>While there are now hundreds of workflow management tools available now my tool will, rather than dumbing down the complexity of the users project or work being managed, it will allow them to review and organise things down to the most minute of detail. It’s possible that this could turn some users off but this tool will be aimed towards those that prefer to see more information of their screen, not less. This will allow managers to be more in touch with what their team members are working on without having to actually talk to them. To be clear this tool will not be for everyone, It is a niche product for specific applications where detailed process tracking is required.
  <P>Description 
    <P>The tool will consist of four main functions from the user’s point of view.
        <P>Building a workflow
      <P>The first stage of using the tool requires the TL and team members to define their processes and workflow. The team will need to create projects or work process and populate them with jobs and assign these jobs to team members. Jobs can be broken down into sub job. Any specific requirements like other jobs being completed first (if the jobs form the same work flow) so information they produce is available or inputs from external teams or maybe files that need to be received can all be added to the job. Jobs also need to assign an expected completion date and if they are reoccurring which days or weeks they need to recur on.
          <P>What am I working on & how can I help?
              <P>TL and Team members need to track what they are working on in the system. So if they are working on a job that exist in a workflow they need to flag them as started and depending on the status of the work as in progress or waiting or stalled. If the team member needs to work on something that is not part of an existing job or workflow they can add this in on the flow and provide a description of the new job and if it fits in to any of the projects that already exist within the team.
              <P>This screen will also show any jobs that other team members are working on that they have flagged as needing assistance on. The other team members will need to provide a short description of the issue they are having or the help that they need. Team members with the time can then jump on to help on the stalled or waiting job. If a job is waiting and the item that they are waiting for is another job from within the team. They can notify that team or team members that they are waiting on their work so that it can be prioritized if needed.
                  <P>What’s my team working on now?
                      <P>This will show the team leader and other team members all of the jobs that each team member is currently working on. Any work that has been started but not yet completed will be displayed here along with a status and an estimated time to completion, critically it will also allow the team leader to see which jobs their team members requite their assistance or input on. The team leader can also flag particular jobs that they want their team to prioritise and flag a preferred finish time/date for that job. If a job is prioritized by the TL the team member will be notified and they can either confirm the priority job or flag the job as needing assistance from either the TL themselves or other team members. Here the team leader can then dive into these jobs to see details from the team members on what is holding up any particular job or just how they are progressing.
                          <P>How are we tracking?
                              <P>This is the summary page that the TL and team will use to track how they are doing with their workflow overall. It will show the progress on current jobs as well and completed and future jobs needed to complete that project.
    
                                                          
   <P>Tools & Technologies
    <P>The project will require a development environment for either java or python, Jet Beans have an IDE for each, the Java IDE is IDEA and the python IDE is PyCharm. Both are available for $15 per month subscriptions and are free to students. These applications will allow for more efficient development and integrate with source control systems like github. There are numerous open source database tools for SQL databases, Mysql Workbench is an ideal open source solution. A computer is needed to do the development and testing of the product. A server is also needed to host the database that stores the information that the tool runs on. Amazon provides Linux virtual machines that could be used to host the database
<P>Skills Required 
  <P>To complete this project I will need to be able to code in either java or python and also be able to create and populate an SQL database. Understanding how to connect the application the server and the database is important as well as creating the queries that will retrieve that data from the database so it can be displayed in the application and write data back to the database from the application. None of these things are unfeasible but they would require some time to be invested in developing enough knowledge to be able to implement the solution.
  <P>Outcome 
    <P> Idealy the product would be open source and free for anyone to use. This would mean that it could be used by other students working on projects or by teams within organisations that need help traking their work. I would not want to sell the pruduct to anyone.
