<H2>My Profile</H2>

<P> Nathan Bresser, s3819728, bressernathan@gmail.com
  
<P> I’m a twenty four year old Canberra native currently living in Sydney and working for a big four consulting firm. My grandparents immigrated from The Netherlands to Australia in the sixties. I graduated high school in 2012 and have about two thirds of the credits to complete a degree in Accounting at the University of Wollongong which I have put on hold to pursue my passion of IT. 
  
<P> One interesting fact about me is that in 2013 I represented Australia at a 3 on 3 basketball tournament in shanghai. We placed second, losing by a point to China in the final.
<P> I’ve been interested in all aspects of IT since I was a young child. At the moment my primary interest is in programming and software development. My interest began when my farther bought our families first computer in 1999. A few years later he went on so pursue a degree in computer science, so computers where a part of mine and my siblings lives from then on. 
<P> After mulling over the decision of whether or not to go ahead with changing career paths from finance to IT I have looking in numerous different courses. Eventually I settled on RMIT through OUA as it allowed me to enrol in courses prior to being accepted into a degree. 
<P> My expectation is to learn about a wide range of subjects relating to IT and to leave the course in a position to pursue a career in an IT role.
