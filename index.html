<H2>My Profile</H2>

<P> <B>Nathan Bresser, s3819728, bressernathan@gmail.com</B>
  
  <P> I’m a twenty four year old Canberra native currently living in Sydney and working for a big four consulting firm. My grandparents immigrated from The Netherlands to Australia in the sixties. I graduated high school in 2012 and have about two thirds of the credits to complete a degree in Accounting at the University of Wollongong which I have put on hold to pursue my passion of IT. 
  
  <P> One interesting fact about me is that in 2013 I represented Australia at a 3 on 3 basketball tournament in shanghai. We placed second, losing by a point to China in the final.
  <P> I’ve been interested in all aspects of IT since I was a young child. At the moment my primary interest is in programming and software development. My interest began when my farther bought our families first computer in 1999. A few years later he went on so pursue a degree in computer science, so computers where a part of mine and my siblings lives from then on. 
  <P> After mulling over the decision of whether or not to go ahead with changing career paths from finance to IT I have looking in numerous different courses. Eventually I settled on RMIT through OUA as it allowed me to enrol in courses prior to being accepted into a degree. 
  <P> My expectation is to learn about a wide range of subjects relating to IT and to leave the course in a position to pursue a career in an IT role.

    <P>MBTI Results
      
    <P>My personally based on the MBIT test I completed was ENFP. My core values indicated by the test were, Curiosity, Self-expression, Variety and Adaptability and my Key motivators were expressing creativity, new ideas, Understanding people and providing acceptance and support. (Truity, 2019)
   <P>The text identified my type code as “the champion”. Champions focus on new possibilities and helping others explore them. They are people focused and general warm, passionate and energetic.
      <P>Learning Style Test Results
    <P>The Learning Style test that I complete indicated that I am a tactile learner (Educationplanner.org, 2019).  My overall breakdown was as follows. 50% tactile, 30% visual and 20% Auditory. Tactile learners learn by physically going through the motions of doing something. They fidget and like to pull things apart and put them back to together again to see how they work.
    <P>Personal Choice of Test  
    <P>I also completed an only psychometric text for abstract reasoning. This required me to find the missing item in sequences and matrixes of shapes and symbols. This was the first time I have attempted a test like this and I was only able to get to 4 of the 15 questions in the seven minutes and thirty seconds of time provided. I was able to answer 3 of the questions correctly. (JobTestPrep, 2019)
   
  <P>The results of these tests mean very little to me. Having taken a few of these kinds of personality and learning type tests I’ve found that the results can vary widely from test to test and how I am feeling on a particular day. I’ve also found that the insights they provide to be of little use, specifically the MBIT. To me it seems to be just regurgitating information you provide in a different format, not telling you anything new about yourself.
  <P>It’s possible that having your learning and personality type given to you might allow you to feel more comfortable being who you are and accepting that you have your own way of acting and reacting to your team members and your own way of taking up information. Being able to relax and be who you are can only help when working in a team in my opinion.
  <P>  Without people going out of their way to publicize the results of these tests it would be difficult to use this information when forming teams, if however you were putting a team together and you had all of this information at hand, I can image that you might at the very least be able to use the results to communicate with you team members about who you are and how best you communicate in learn.
